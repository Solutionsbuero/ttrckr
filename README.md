## Installation

This program relies on the OpenCV Library. For convenience this project uses the unofficial pre-built OpenCV binaries from [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).

_Raspberry Pi:_ You have to add the [Piwheels](https://www.piwheels.org/) Wheel Repository to your system to obtain the OpenCV Binaries for your system.
